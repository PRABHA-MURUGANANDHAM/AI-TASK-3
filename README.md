## 🧠 What is it?

**Multimodal AI Tutor** is an interactive AI-powered educational assistant that enables users—especially students—to ask questions **using voice** and receive intelligent explanations **based on uploaded diagrams or images**. It merges the power of **speech recognition** and **visual reasoning** to deliver clear, insightful answers powered by cutting-edge AI models.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎤 **Voice-to-Text Understanding**  
  Speak your question instead of typing it. The system transcribes it automatically.

- 🖼️ **Visual Reasoning with Diagrams**  
  Upload handwritten notes, textbook diagrams, or images. The AI interprets the image and relates it to your question.

- 💡 **AI-Powered Explanations**  
  Combines your spoken query and the visual content to generate a detailed explanation using **Google Gemini AI**.

- 🌐 **Instant Web Access**  
  Hosted with **Gradio**, making it easy to access and share via a public link—no installation needed.

## 🎯 Use Case Example

1. A student uploads a diagram of a triangle labeled with angles and sides.
2. The student asks (via voice): _"How do I find the area of this triangle?"_
3. The AI transcribes the question, processes the image, and returns a step-by-step explanation.
